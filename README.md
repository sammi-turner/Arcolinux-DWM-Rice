# Arcolinux-Dotfiles

Basic dots for a fresh install of ArcolinuxB (KDE Plasma edition).

## Tweak Tool

Using the 'Autostart' tab on the 'Arcolinux Tweak Tool', I prefer to disable 'variety' and 'am-conky-session'.

## Wallpapers

In the '~/.local/share' directory, I like to add my own 'wallpaper' directory and use the 'slideshow' setting to randomly select a new wallpaper every five minutes.

## Ricing

I recommend installing the [N-Global-Theme](https://store.kde.org/p/1590092), editing the bottom panel and changing the font settings (I like 'Source Code Pro' at 10pt). The N-Global theme goes nicely with the [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/), which is available for most userland apps.

## Firefox checklist

- Customise the homepage.
- Install the Dracula theme.
- Install the uBlock Origin extension.
- Install Midnight Lizard extension.
- Install the Dracula theme for Midnight Lizard using the 'get more themes' link.
